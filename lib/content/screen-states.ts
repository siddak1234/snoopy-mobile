/**
 * The words the shared data states render, transcribed from the design.
 *
 * One grammar covers every fetching screen (`gLoad` / `gErr` / `gOff` in
 * `Screen.dc.html`): a skeleton in the screen's own layout, a failed load with
 * Retry and Go back, and an offline hero. Only the failed-load *title* differs
 * per screen, so only that is a map.
 *
 * The design ratified the boundary between the two kinds of failure, and it is
 * worth restating because it decides which treatment a screen reaches for:
 * `gErr` and `gOff` are **load** states, shown when there is nothing on screen
 * yet. A failure of an *action* on data that did load is **always inline** — a
 * callout naming what did not happen, with the data left in place. Nothing the
 * person was reading is destroyed in order to report an error.
